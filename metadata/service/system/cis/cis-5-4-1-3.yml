# CIS 5.4.1.3 Ensure password expiration warning days is 7 or more (Scored)
#
# Description
# ===========
# The PASS_WARN_AGE parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator to
# notify users that their password will expire in a defined number of days.
# It is recommended that the PASS_WARN_AGE parameter be set to 7 or more days.
#
# Rationale
# =========
# Providing an advance warning that a password will be expiring gives users
# time to think of a secure password. Users caught unaware may choose a simple
# password or write it down where it may be discovered.
#
# Audit
# =====
# Run the following command and verify PASS_WARN_AGE is 7 or more:
#
#   # grep PASS_WARN_AGE /etc/login.defs
#   PASS_WARN_AGE 7
#
# Verify all users with a password have their number of days of warning before
# password expires set to 7 or more:
#
#   # egrep ^[^:]+:[^\!*] /etc/shadow | cut -d: -f1
#   <list of users>
#   # chage --list <user>
#   Number of days of warning before password expires: 7
#
# Remediation
# ===========
#
# Set the PASS_WARN_AGE parameter to 7 in /etc/login.defs :
#
#   PASS_WARN_AGE 7
#
# Modify user parameters for all users with a password set to match:
#
#   # chage --warndays 7 <user>
#
# Notes
# =====
# You can also check this setting in /etc/shadow directly. The 6th field
# should be 7 or more for all users with a password.
