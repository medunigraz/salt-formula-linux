# CIS 5.4.1.2 Ensure minimum days between password changes is 7 or more (Scored)
#
# Description
# ===========
# The PASS_MIN_DAYS parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator to
# prevent users from changing their password until a minimum number of days
# have passed since the last time the user changed their password. It is
# recommended that PASS_MIN_DAYS parameter be set to 7 or more days.
#
# Rationale
# =========
# By restricting the frequency of password changes, an administrator can
# prevent users from repeatedly changing their password in an attempt to
# circumvent password reuse controls.
#
# Audit
# =====
# Run the following command and verify PASS_MIN_DAYS is 7 or more:
#
#   # grep PASS_MIN_DAYS /etc/login.defs
#   PASS_MIN_DAYS 7
#
# Verify all users with a password have their minimum days between password
# change set to 7 or more:
#
#   # egrep ^[^:]+:[^\!*] /etc/shadow | cut -d: -f1
#   <list of users>
#   # chage --list <user>
#   Minimum number of days between password change: 7
#
# Remediation
# ===========
# Set the PASS_MIN_DAYS parameter to 7 in /etc/login.defs :
#
#   PASS_MIN_DAYS 7
#
# Modify user parameters for all users with a password set to match:
#
#   # chage --mindays 7 <user>
#
# Notes
# =====
# You can also check this setting in /etc/shadow directly. The 5th field
# should be 7 or more for all users with a password.
